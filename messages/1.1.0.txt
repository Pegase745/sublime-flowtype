FlowType 1.1.0
==============

## Changed
  * Search and use the nearest usable flow binary.
  The value of "flow_bin_path" in the settings is now optional.
  If it's set, it will be used. If not, the plugin will search for a local project's flow binary,
  or else use the system global one in your PATH.
